# ToDo Application

A simple, user-friendly To-Do application built using Android's MVVM architecture with Room database. This app helps users manage their tasks by adding, deleting, and updating them with a clear and organized UI.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Add tasks with titles and descriptions.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with a delete button.
- **View All Tasks**: View the list of tasks in a RecyclerView with a toggleable description view.
- **Room Database**: Persistent storage for tasks, even if the app is closed.
- **MVVM Architecture**: Organized structure with ViewModel and Repository for effective data management.

## Project Structure

- **`Task.kt`**: Defines the data model for a task, with attributes for title, description, completion status, and an auto-generated primary key.
- **`TaskDao.kt`**: The Data Access Object (DAO) with methods for inserting, deleting, and retrieving tasks from the database.
- **`TaskDatabase.kt`**: Room database instance for managing the task database.
- **`TaskRepository.kt`**: Repository layer for abstracting the data access from the rest of the app.
- **`TaskViewModel.kt`**: ViewModel for managing UI-related data and using coroutines for database operations.
- **`RecyclerAdapter.kt`**: RecyclerView adapter for displaying tasks in a card layout, with options to delete, update.
- **`MainActivity.kt`**: Main UI activity for initializing and managing the task list, including the add task dialog.
